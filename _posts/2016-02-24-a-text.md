So what would a text post look like in this layout? Well, this is me finding out. I love to show off my photography, but I also like to write a thing or two along the way. I don't have great thoughts. I don't take great photographs. I just like to see it all up there neat and pretty. 

My photographs won't likely hang in any art gallery and I doubt my writing will ever be published other than in this medium. Maybe I just need practice or maybe I just need this. This is enough for me.

When I first heard about the Grid, I was intrigued. I spent so much time tweaking my WordPress site that I never got around to posting any content. I imagined the Grid to be a way to free me from worrying about design tweaks and finally set about other artistic pursuits. Like content.   
Here's hoping...
