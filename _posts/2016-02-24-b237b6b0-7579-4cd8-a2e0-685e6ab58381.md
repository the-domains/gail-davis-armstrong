It appears that tweaking the layout slightly has helped with the text post showing up properly on the post's page. Unfortunately, any layout seems to have issues across mobile devices. Right now it looks fine on my iPad Air 2, but woeful on my iPhone 6\. 

I'm still wondering... What about dated entries? And how will my visitors know to click on a post to read further? Am I going to have to manually do these things within each post? Will there be the ability to add a commenting system?These are all secondary to the immediate visual design issues I am having. I will perservere...
