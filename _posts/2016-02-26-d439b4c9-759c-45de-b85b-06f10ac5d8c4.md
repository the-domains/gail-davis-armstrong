I'm starting to feel like there's nothing more that I can do until the Grid improves dramatically. There's no clear indication that a post is longer than what appears on the front page without me asking someone to click on the photo or the title of the post. I will read what little there is to read and continue to try. I'm not sure how anyone can be considered a beta tester with no way to have a conversation with the rest of the beta community and the developers. Does anyone want my input? Can anyone help? How do I get rid of "brand" colors? How do I create paragraphs without having to allude to the fact that the reader would need to click on the photo or title of the post to read on? Why won't these sites show up properly across different browsers? These are all basic things.
