I'm starting to feel like there's nothing more that I can do until the Grid improves dramatically. There's no clear indication that a post is longer than what appears on the front page without me asking someone to click on the photo or the title of the post. I will read what little there is to read and continue to try. I'm not sure how anyone can be considered a beta tester with no way to have a conversation with the rest of the beta community and the developers. Does anyone want my input? Can anyone help?
